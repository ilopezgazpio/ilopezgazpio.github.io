<h1 class="project-tagline">Teaching is not just part of my academic duties</h1>

As a professor at [the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)](http://www.ehu.eus/en){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex"},
teaching is not just part of my academic duties, but a cornerstone of my professional identity.
I have dedicated my career to educating the next generation of engineers, scientists, and technologists by combining academic excellence with innovative, hands-on learning methods.
My mission is to make complex topics like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Search Metaheuristics, and Machine Learning (ML) both accessible and inspiring.

<h2 class="project-tagline">Plenty of in-class hours, and still enjoying :)</h2>

Over the years, I’ve delivered more than 1,000 hours of university-level instruction, consistently earning top-tier evaluations from students.
My courses span undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral programs, and include subjects such as:
<li> Artificial Intelligence </li>
<li> Software Engineering </li>
<li> Search Techniques for Optimization </li>
<li> Advanced Machine Learning </li>
<li> Big data </li>
<li> Databases </li>

I am especially proud of how these courses integrate technical rigor with real-world applicability, helping students not only understand the theory but also apply it in solving meaningful problems.

<h2 class="project-tagline">Tinker philosophy</h2>

My teaching style is rooted in a philosophy of curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking.
I design learning experiences that are student-centered, project-based, and aligned with the demands of today’s technology-driven industries.
Whether we’re coding deep learning models in Python, developing Arduino-based robotic systems, or exploring algorithmic problem solving, my aim is always the same: empower students with tools, confidence, and purpose.

Beyond the classroom, I actively contribute to teaching innovation through educational resources and training.
I’ve authored a practical textbook on [Git and version control](https://www.ueu.eus/argitaletxea/liburuak/git-bertsioak-kontrolatzeko-sistemarako-eskuliburua){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex"},
which is now widely used by students and colleagues and regularly collaborate on curriculum development initiatives.
I also participate in teacher training and faculty development programs, with a special focus on interdisciplinary and digitally enriched education.

<h2 class="project-tagline">Devoted to open-source tools</h2>

I strongly advocate for the use of open-source tools in the classroom, including Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Blender, and 3D printing technologies.
These tools not only enrich the learning experience but also cultivate a maker mindset, which I think is essential for agile problem solving and innovation in today’s engineering landscape.

<h2 class="project-tagline">Education is more than content delivery</h2>

Education, to me, is about more than content delivery.
It’s about mentorship, inclusion, and shaping socially responsible professionals.
I strive to create an environment where every student feels challenged, supported, and inspired to pursue their full potential.

<h2 class="project-tagline">Teaching means never stop learning</h2>

Through my teaching, I hope to instill not only technical expertise but also the lifelong learning habits and ethical frameworks that define a great engineer or scientist.
Because ultimately, education is the most powerful engine of progress—and I’m proud to help drive it forward.

Never stop learning!
