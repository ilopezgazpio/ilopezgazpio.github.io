<h1 class="project-tagline">Hi there! I'm Inigo Lopez-Gazpio </h1>

Currently I'm an Assistant Professor at [the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)](http://www.ehu.eus/en){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex"},
specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and advanced technologies in education.
With over a decade of academic experience and a strong interdisciplinary background, I focus on bridging the gap between <b>machine learning theory, deep learning theory and real-world applications</b>,
particularly in <b>computational linguistics, educational innovation, and smart navigation systems</b>.

<h2 class="project-tagline">Don't hesitate to contact me</h2>

<h2 class="project-tagline">Academic journey</h2>

Holding a Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing and a Master's degree in the same field, both from UPV/EHU, I've authored more than 45 peer-reviewed publications in leading international journals and conferences.
My work has been cited nearly 3,000 times, reflecting its impact in the fields of AI, NLP, and computer science.
I've collaborated in major research projects at European, national, and regional levels, including H2020 projects like ACROBA and LOGISTAR, and regional AI initiatives in transport optimization and industrial automation.

<h2 class="project-tagline">I'm deeply passionate about teaching and consider it one of my most fulfilling professional pursuits</h2>

I have lectured a variety of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Artificial Intelligence, Search Metaheuristics, Advanced Machine Learning, and Software Engineering.
Over the years, I've delivered more than 1,000 hours of classroom instruction with consistently high student evaluations.
I'm passionate about using open-source technologies such as Python, Arduino, and 3D printing to enhance teaching and applied research.
My approach blends theoretical rigor with hands-on practice, aligning with modern industry needs and innovation in STEAM education.

<h2 class="project-tagline">Beyond teaching and research</h2>

Beyond teaching and research, I am an active contributor to educational resource development and pedagogical innovation.
I've published a [textbook on Git for version control](https://www.ueu.eus/argitaletxea/liburuak/git-bertsioak-kontrolatzeko-sistemarako-eskuliburua){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex"}
and regularly participate in teacher training programs aimed at improving digital and interdisciplinary education.
My commitment to open science, reproducibility, and collaborative research is also evident in my [Github repositories and published software tools](https://github.com/ilopezgazpio/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex"}.

I am affiliated with the [iXa research unit](https://www.ixa.eus/?language=en){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex"} and [HiTZ Center for Language Technology](https://www.hitz.eus/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex"},
and serve as a reviewer and program committee member for leading international conferences in AI and NLP.
I've also been recognized with awards for teaching excellence and academic achievement, including the Kutxa Final Career Award and best thesis honors.

My academic mission is to develop intelligent systems that enhance human capability, support inclusive education, and contribute to a more sustainable and digitally literate society.
Through research, mentorship, and outreach, I strive to inspire the next generation of engineers, scientists, and innovators.

<h2 class="project-tagline">Other projects</h2>

Finally, as a computer scientist, enthusiast, and tinkerer, I actively engage in various projects related to research and education.
Since 2024, I have been a member of the coordination board of the 3D Laboratory at the Faculty of Informatics.
Additionally, I am the founder of the [Drone Eskola](https://www.droneskola.eus){:target="_blank"} project,
which aims to democratize the dissemination of drone technology in the Basque Country by providing open-access educational content.
From 2024 onwards I also collaborate in the [Gatai project](https://www.gatai.eus){:target="_blank"} which aims to deliver complex terms to kids by means of teacher education programs and illustrated albums.
