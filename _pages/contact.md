<h1 class="project-tagline">Always ready to talk about education or science</h1>

I'm always happy to connect with students, researchers, and collaborators who are passionate about technology, language, or innovation.
Whether you’re exploring an idea, developing a project, or simply curious about artificial intelligence, natural language processing, or machine learning I encourage you to reach out.

If you’re a student at [the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)](http://www.ehu.eus/en){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex"} or an international student
and looking for guidance or supervision on a thesis, master's, research project, or even a creative side experiment, don’t hesitate to get in touch.
I strongly believe that learning happens best through collaboration, mentorship, and hands-on problem solving.

You can contact me via email at <a href="mailto:inigo.lopez@ehu.eus"> inigo dot lopez at ehu dot eus  </a> or visit my office during office hours.

Let’s talk about your ideas and see how we can bring them to life together.

<h1 class="project-tagline">Past experiences with students in which I learnt a lot!</h1>

The following ones are some examples of final degree projects or master's that I have supervised with success:

<li> <b> In the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field: </b> development of ML and DL models for Semantic Textual Similarity and Natural Language Inference, analysis of hazards concerning LLM evaluation, analysis of inference failures such as the reversal curse, etc. </li>

<li> <b> In the 3D field: </b> exploration of the potential of 3D printing, modeling and virtual reality to enhance and improve engagement in education. </li>

<li> <b> In the heuristics field: </b> Optimization of the rich Vehicle Routing problem (VRP) for horizontal collaboration and multimodality and other domain specific optimizations proposed by students from the <i>Search heuristics</i> lecture. </li>

<li> <b> In the autonomous navigation field: </b> development of Unmanned Aerial Vechicle (UAV) technology through reinforcement learning and gymnasium API. </li>
