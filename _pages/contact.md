<h1 class="project-tagline">Always ready to talk about education or science</h1>

I'm always happy to connect with students, researchers, and collaborators who are passionate about technology, language, or innovation.
Whether you’re exploring an idea, developing a project, or simply curious about artificial intelligence, natural language processing, or machine learning I encourage you to reach out.

If you’re a student at [the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)](http://www.ehu.eus/en){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex"}
and looking for guidance or supervision on a thesis, master's, research project, or even a creative side experiment, don’t hesitate to get in touch.
I strongly believe that learning happens best through collaboration, mentorship, and hands-on problem solving.

You can contact me via email at <a href="mailto:inigo.lopez@ehu.eus"> inigo dot lopez at ehu dot eus  </a> or visit my office during office hours.

Let’s talk about your ideas and see how we can bring them to life together.
